<p>In addition, you are apt to need ...</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>Pliobond cement (manufactured by Goodyear)</dt>
<dt>tooling aluminum or copper (from craft or hobby shops)</dt>
<dt>Balsa wood in &frac12;&Prime; and 1&Prime; thick boards, or slabs of styrofoam plastic. Balsa wood from hobby shops; styrofoam from florists, ten-cent stores, or insulation companies.</dt>
<dt>assorted twigs and dried weeds, collected in the Fall</dt>
<dt>sawdust sifted into fine, medium, and coarse grades</dt>
<dt>&ldquo;Rit&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tintex&rdquo; dye&mdash;greens and browns</dt>

<div class="pb" id="Page_1">1</div>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">BOX PREPARATION AND BACKGROUND</span></h2>
<p>The box can be designed with the lid to open up, down or to
one side. The main label is pasted inside the lid.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p01.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="500" height="199" />
</div>
<p>The box is painted on the outside, either with any of the
rubber-base (latex) paints, or with paint from a spray can.
The inside of the box is given one or two coats of the black
latex paint. (Other flat black paints may also be used.)</p>
<p>Be very sure to wash any brushes that are used with the
latex paint very soon after use. Use warm water and bar
soap (such as Ivory). Once the rubber-base paint hardens
there is little that can be done to restore the bristles.</p>
<p>A piece of black construction paper is cut to fit the box interior
in a curve from one side to the other. The magazine
picture or large post-card you are using for the background
is pasted to the construction paper, using Tri-Tix rubber
cement. Then this curved paper is pasted to the box.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p01a.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="500" height="252" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">FOREGROUND BLOCKS AND FIGURES</span></h2>
<p>If it is desired, a foreground base can be made with a block
of balsa wood or a piece of styrofoam plastic. The material
is carved to blend, in surface contours, with the background
picture. If the background picture has land with uneven contours,
with hills or bluffs, it will be best to carve the block
with a slope down away from the front of the box.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" alt="(FRONT, CROSS-SECTION)" width="500" height="91" />
</div>
<p>If the background picture shows a low, level, flat area, the
foreground block should be carved sloping up at the back.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02a.jpg" alt="(FRONT, CROSS-SECTION)" width="500" height="96" />
</div>
<p>If a flat base is desired, Elmer&rsquo;s glue is brushed on the
bottom inside of the box and sand, gravel, dyed sawdust or
other texture is sprinkled on the wet glue, after the figures
are glued in place.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>The foreground is made from cut-out pictures or from figures
and accessories from hobby shops, ten-cent stores or
other sources.</p>
<p>There are two methods of using magazine pictures for the
foreground figures:</p>
<p>(1) Paste the pictures to index cards or cardboard of similar
weight. Use Tri-Tix cement. Put the picture face down
on scrap paper; brush or spread a thin but complete coat of
Tri-Tix on the back of the picture. Work from the center
out, in radiating strokes.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02e.jpg" alt="SCRAP PAPER" width="500" height="131" />
</div>
<p>Turning the picture over, place the center of the picture
down on the cardboard. Smooth down from the center out.
Place piece of waxed or scrap paper over picture, roll down
with a linoleum brayer or rolling pin. This helps to remove
all air bubbles.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02f.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="176" height="95" />
</div>
<p>Let cement dry completely before trimming picture. When
the excess rubber cement (squeezed out on the scrap paper)
has changed from milky white to a translucent material, the
cement on the picture will be dry. Cutting against the plate
glass, trim out the parts of the picture needed with the X-Acto
knife. Cutting against the glass produces a cleaner
edge than against a different surface.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>If your foreground is the flat side of the box, without carved
balsa or styrofoam block, leave tabs on the bottoms of the
trimmed figures. Fold these tabs back and glue to base.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="TAB" width="500" height="188" />
</div>
<p>If your foreground is of carved balsa or styrofoam, trim
out figure completely, then glue supporting wire to the back.
Straightened paper clips may be used, being glued down
with Elmer&rsquo;s glue. Let about &frac12;&Prime; of wire extend from
bottom of figure. When glue is dry, force wire into base.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03c.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="491" height="252" />
</div>
<p>(2) The second method of using pictures is to glue the picture
to a piece of light weight (tooling) aluminum or copper
(about 32 oz. weight). Brush Pliobond on the back of the
picture, smooth picture on aluminum or copper. Press out
all air bubbles. The Pliobond holds immediately; there is
no need to wait. Use scissors to cut out the picture. Manicure
scissors will help in small areas. Narrow strips,
such as the legs of animals, will curl, but the Pliobond will
hold the paper tight, and the metal can be straightened.
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
Fold a rag or smooth-finish hand towel (not terry cloth) into
a soft pad. Place trimmed picture face down on pad. Using
a dental tool, rounded end of a nut pick, leather modelling
tools or similar equipment, work the metal into a rounded
form. Tool in the same manner as in regular copper work.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03d.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="500" height="248" />
</div>
<p>When completely tooled, the figure will have an appearance
similar to that of bas-relief. Again, the figures are reinforced
with wire glued to the back, using Pliobond. As
with the cardboard backed figures, the wire should extend
about &frac12;&Prime; from the bottom of the figure. The figure is
fastened in the same manner, by forcing the wire into the
base block.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03e.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="500" height="267" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>If the foreground figure does not stand higher than the cigar
box is deep, it may be placed on the lid of the box, and the
background material carefully located so that the lid will
still close.</p>
<div class="img">

</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">ACCESSORIES</span></h2>
<h3 id="c4">Ground:</h3>
<p>All ground has texture, whether it is a pine-needle blanketed
slope or an asphalt pavement. The surface beneath our
feet looks nothing at all as does a painted surface. So it is,
that one of the most important points to remember in creating
an illusion of reality and depth in a diorama, whether it
is of cigar box or department store window size, is to create
an appropriate foreground texture.</p>
<p>The balsa wood or styrofoam block you may have used in
your foreground provides the main shape and bulk of that
foreground. A good paper-mache mix can be made by mixing
equal parts of Plaster-of-Paris, yellow dextrine, and
powdered asbestos. The plaster and asbestos can be found
in building supply stores, and the yellow dextrine at the
chemical supply houses. Denver Fire Clay has the yellow
dextrine in Denver. Put these three dry ingredients in a jar
and shake them until they are well distributed. The mix can
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
be stored dry. To use, add water to the dry mix to the consistency
of putty or a very thick paste, mixing just enough to
use at one time. The mache will form a &ldquo;skin&rdquo; on the surface
in about an hour, but can be pushed and modelled somewhat
longer. It will dry to a rock-like hardness overnight.
If you plan to build up much thickness, it is best to do it in
several thin layers. Let each layer dry before adding the
next. The mache mix is spread over the balsa wood or
styrofoam block with the palette knife or flexible spatula,
to a thickness of no more than &sup1;/&#8321;&#8326;&Prime;. If the mix sticks to
the palette knife (or to your fingers), moisten the knife just
a little, and the material will not stick.</p>
<p>The mache can be used to make a smooth joint between the
foreground block that slopes up at the back and the picture
background. Try to make this joint a smooth curve, not a
sharp angle.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04a.jpg" alt="MACHE MIX" width="500" height="385" />
</div>
<p>Cliff faces and large rocks, or formations such as those in
a &ldquo;moonscape&rdquo;, can be carved from styrofoam chunks. The
blocks or chunks are fastened together by using wooden toothpicks
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
and Elmer&rsquo;s glue. The complete foreground is then
covered with a layer of the paper mache mix to hide the obvious
plastic texture. Again, Elmer&rsquo;s glue is brushed on
and the &ldquo;rocks&rdquo; are given a texture with fine sawdust or
sand.</p>
<div class="img">

<p>Another type of cliff face, with a carved cave opening (for
bears, prehistoric cave dwellers, etc.) is made in the same
way. In mounting, the background picture is curved on just
one side and the carved cliff face occupies the full depth of
the cigar box on the side opposite the curve.</p>

</div>
<p>If grass-like &ldquo;weeds&rdquo; or plants are to be shown in the foreground
they can be made of hemp rope cut and pushed into
the wet mache mix. Dye the hemp green with &ldquo;Rit&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Tintex&rdquo; before using. The adhesive quality of the mix will
hold the strands securely. When the mache mix has dried
to a rock hardness, the ground is painted with a thick coat
of Elmer&rsquo;s glue and sprinkled with a generous layer of
varying textures and colors. Very fine sawdust already
dyed a bright green is available at model railroad shops as
model railroad &ldquo;grass&rdquo;. If you prefer a less brilliant color,
you may dye sawdust with the Rit or Tintex.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05d.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="500" height="196" />
</div>
<p>Take two one pound coffee cans. Punch holes in the bottom
of one with a hammer and nail. Hold the coffee can against
a scrap of 2&Prime; &times; 4&Prime; wood when you punch the holes. Set up
the cans, the &ldquo;sieve&rdquo; on top. Fill the top can about half
full of sawdust. Heat two or three cups of water to boiling
point. Drop in dye tablet or powder and let it dissolve.</p>
<p>Pour hot dye over sawdust. The dye can be poured through
the sawdust as many times as is necessary to get the depth
of color desired. Spread wet sawdust out on newspapers to
dry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>It is a good idea to dye several batches with different greens
and browns, and to sift the dried sawdust through a piece of
window screen, then a kitchen sieve, to get fine, medium
and coarse grades. A different texture can be made by
grinding up a &frac14;&Prime; wooden dowel (available at hardware
stores or lumber companies) in a clean pencil sharpener.
When you glue the sawdust&mdash;or fine sand&mdash;or any other
texture to the base, vary the color and the texture. Use
some light green and some dark, and add a little brown or
tan of a finer texture than the green, to resemble dirt showing
through the grass. Gravel ranging from BB shot to
garden pea size can be used for larger rocks. It is also a
good idea to use coarse textures near the front of the box,
fine textures at the rear, to approximate a correct textural
perspective.</p>
<p>The most important thing to do in putting in this dirt and
grass covering is to observe nature itself as closely as it is
possible, seeing just how patches of vegetation grow&mdash;whether
slopes are bare and what the &ldquo;mosaic&rdquo; of dirt and
greenness is. The foreground will look natural only if it
is based on observed knowledge of the actual relationships in
nature.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="(unlabelled)" width="500" height="175" />
</div>
<h3 id="c5">Bushes and Shrubs ...</h3>
<p>can be made with the previously described hemp method and
by using lichen from model railroad shops, dried weeds and
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
twigs, fern-like material (actually a kind of seaweed) usually
sold at Christmas time by ten-cent stores, by using cut
paper and any other material that appears appropriate.
Sponges are not recommended. Somehow, they always
resemble nothing but sponges.</p>
<p><i>Lichen</i> can be torn into little clumps and fastened to the
base with Elmer&rsquo;s glue.</p>
<p><i>Dried weeds and twigs</i> can be dipped in Elmer&rsquo;s glue, then
sprinkled with or dipped into the dyed sawdust to get a different
texture in a bush. If you have cut tiny scraps of
colored paper, these can be spotted on the lichen or dried
weed bushes to resemble flowers. A toothpick will help to
put just one drop of glue on the bush&mdash;and the same glue-dipped
toothpick will then pick up the fleck of color to put it
in place.</p>
<p><i>Unprinted newspaper</i> (available in pads from art supply
stores) can be used to make the spears at the base of a
yucca tree. Cut a strip of unprinted newspaper. Slash it.</p>
<div class="img">

<h3 id="c6">Ferns and palms ...</h3>
<p>Ferns and palms are made by gluing a wire (get a spool of
22 or 23 gauge wire from a hardware store) between two
lengths of gummed paper tape. Let wire extend beyond
paper tape for length of stem or trunk plus the usual &frac12;&Prime;
for pushing into the base.</p>

<h3 id="c7"><i>Water</i></h3>
<p>A quiet pond may be made with a mirror. Glue the mirror
to the cigar box before installing anything else. Glue in the
background picture next, then carve chunks of styrofoam
for the remaining foreground. Slope &ldquo;shores&rdquo; down toward
mirror &ldquo;pond&rdquo;. Let the edges of the styrofoam cover edges
of mirror, making an irregular shape for the pond. Glue
styrofoam in place with Elmer&rsquo;s. For added realism,
ripples may be added to the mirror surface, using clear
varnish and oil paints. Mix a tiny bit of Prussian or &ldquo;Thalo&rdquo;
blue with some clear varnish. Use just enough to tint the
varnish. Flow varnish on surface of mirror, to a depth of
about &sup1;/&#8323;&#8322;&Prime;. Before varnish is completely dry, use an
empty &ldquo;Flit&rdquo; gun to pump air over the surface. This air
will form ripples which, as the varnish dries, will remain
on the surface. It may be necessary to repeat the air pumping
a few times before the varnish surface hardens.</p>

<p>A stream can be made using broken glass and some Duco or
Testor&rsquo;s Airplane cement. The light blue glass from broken
telephone line insulators, light blue Mexican glass or other
glass of a light blue color may be used. Put the glass in a
paper sack, then put that sack into two more sacks. Put
the sacks on a solid surface and break the glass into small
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
pieces by hitting the sack with a hammer.</p>
<p>Make your foreground with styrofoam or balsa wood chunks,
covering the material with the paper mache mix and working
out (modelling) the stream bed with the mix. Let the
mache harden before completing the stream. While the mix
is still soft, push in weeds, cattails, any correct streamside
plants, making them from hemp rope or from other
previously described materials.</p>
<div class="img">

</div>
<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>ROPE STRANDS DIPPED IN GLUE OR PLASTER FOR CATTAILS....</dt>
<dt>ROCKS PLACED IN DRY STREAM BED.</dt></dl>
<p>When the stream bed is hard, paint the bottom with a blue
paint; lighten this blue color as you paint from the bottom
toward the sides. Along the banks of the stream, paint in a
light brown color. Let the paint dry completely. Squirt a
small amount of Duco or Testor&rsquo;s along the stream bottom;
sprinkle pieces of glass thickly in glue before the glue sets.
Push the glass into the glue to be sure it is well anchored.
Squirt more cement over top of glass until top surface looks
the same as a stream surface. Again, follow nature as
closely as it is possible. Base your stream direction, flow,
eddies, and riffles on observed knowledge. Mix a little
talcum powder in some of the glue and stir quickly and hard
to get a froth. Use this white, frothy material along the
part of the stream surface that would be frothy. If you want
the &ldquo;water&rdquo; to be breaking over boulders in the stream bed,
place pea-size gravel pebbles in the stream bed at the same
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
time you place the glass fragments.</p>
<p>Another method for a stream uses aluminum foil and light
blue cellophane. Using ordinary household aluminum foil,
tear off enough to cover the bottom of your stream area.
Crumple the foil tightly, then smooth it out and glue to the
base with Duco, Testor&rsquo;s, or Pliobond. Cut a piece of blue-green
cellophane to fit over the foil. Crumple the cellophane
tightly, then smooth out. Glue the cellophane to the foil
with Duco or Testor&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Finish both of the above stream methods by painting Elmer&rsquo;s
glue along the banks and shore, covering the edge of the
water area, then sprinkle with sand, sawdust, or other texture,
and complete the vegetation as previously described.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">LARGER DISPLAYS</span></h2>
<p>Most of the methods used in making the cigar box exhibits
can be used in preparing larger displays, but the immediate
problem presented is that of the setting, since there are no
standard size boxes of the correct proportions into which to
put your foreground material. This is easily solved. Use
Elmer&rsquo;s glue and carpet tacks to fasten a piece of pebble-board,
matt board, or poster board to two 1&Prime; &times; 1&frac12;&Prime;

using. Get the brush wet, then scrub up a good lather with
Ivory or similar bar soap; squeeze most of the lather out
of the brush, but do not wash it out. Then, in its lathered
state, use the brush with the Tri-Tix. Wash it out immediately
after use. The soap remaining in the brush during
the glueing process will make the brush easy to clean.</p>

<p>Remember always, that it is not necessary for a person to
have trained artistic ability to produce interesting exhibits.
Imagination and the ability to try something new are the
only requirements. Materials can be found, sometimes,
in most unlikely spots ... aquarium supply stores, novelty
shops. Once one has become conscious of the possibilities,
miniature things leap into view from the store shelves,
and whole forests of trees can be seen in a weed.</p>

or made by the students as projects for the unit. They are
useful as follow-up projects after a field trip to a museum,
industry, or other place of interest.</p>
<p>One need not be an artist to create interesting and acceptable
displays. There are many items available from
novelty stores, souvenir counters, or ten-cent stores,
which can be adapted to use in the cigar boxes. Pictures
clipped from magazines can be used for backgrounds, as
can the large picture post-cards now found nearly everywhere.</p>
<p>The person who exercises imagination, seeing space ships
in plastic hair curlers and rocket ships in metal pencil
protectors, will enjoy making the exhibits and will be able
to share the creative experience with others.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
